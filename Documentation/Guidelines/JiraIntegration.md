# Jira Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Jira with our BetterWYD project to improve task tracking, sprint planning, and overall project management.

## Goals

- Connect our development workflow with Jira for seamless issue tracking
- Automate status updates based on Git commits and pull requests
- Provide visibility into project progress for all team members
- Standardize the development process with Jira workflows

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup Jira Project**
   - Create a new Jira project for BetterWYD
   - Configure appropriate issue types (Story, Bug, Task, Epic)
   - Setup initial workflows and board configurations

2. **Git Integration**
   - Implement Git commit hooks to reference Jira tickets
   - Configure branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/BWYD-123-short-description`)
   - Setup automated status transitions based on branch activities

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Connect Jira with our CI/CD pipeline
   - Update Jira tickets with build and deployment statuses
   - Generate release notes based on resolved issues

4. **Team Onboarding**
   - Create documentation for team members on Jira usage
   - Conduct training sessions for the development team
   - Establish best practices for ticket creation and management

## Conventions

### Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feature/BWYD-{issue-number}-short-description`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/BWYD-{issue-number}-short-description`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/BWYD-{issue-number}-short-description`

### Commit Messages

Commits should reference the Jira ticket in the message:

```
BWYD-123: Implement user authentication

- Added login form
- Created backend validation
- Setup JWT token generation
```
