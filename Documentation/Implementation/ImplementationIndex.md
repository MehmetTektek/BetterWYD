# BetterWYD Implementation Documentation Index

## Overview

This document serves as a central index for all implementation-specific documentation in the BetterWYD project. Each major system has its own dedicated folder within the Implementation directory to organize documentation related to that system's development, usage, and integration.

## Adding New Implementation Documentation

When adding documentation for a new implementation:

1. Place the documentation file in the appropriate system folder
2. Update this index with the new documentation information
3. Maintain the standard documentation format as defined in [DocumentationStandards.md](../Guidelines/DocumentationStandards.md)

## Integration References

For information on how systems integrate with each other, refer to the [Technical Design Document](../TechnicalDesignDocument.md) and the [Architecture](../Architecture/) documentation.
