# Inventory System Test Results

## Overview

This document contains the test results and verification status for the BetterWYD inventory system implementation. The inventory system is a core component of the game, responsible for managing player items, equipment, and resources.

## Test Environment

- **Unity Version**: Unity 6
- **Test Scene**: Assets/Scenes/InventorySystemTest.unity
- **Test Script**: Assets/Core/Systems/Inventory/InventoryTester.cs
- **Date of Testing**: April 24, 2025

## Test Cases and Results

The inventory system has been tested with the following test cases:

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Add Single Item | Adding a single item to the inventory | Not Run | |
| Item Stacking | Adding multiple of the same item to test stacking functionality | Not Run | |
| Inventory Capacity | Adding items until inventory is full to test capacity limits | Not Run | |
| Remove Item | Removing items from the inventory | Not Run | |
| Move Items | Moving items between inventory slots | Not Run | |
| Split Stack | Splitting a stack of items into two separate slots | Not Run | |
| Optimize Stacks | Testing the stack optimization functionality | Not Run | |
| Cross-Platform Compatibility | Testing on both macOS and Windows | Not Run | |
| Memory Usage | Monitoring memory allocation during heavy usage | Not Run | |
| Performance | Testing performance with large numbers of inventory operations | Not Run | |

## Cross-Platform Verification

### macOS Tests
- Status: Not Run
- Test Hardware: MacBook Pro
- Operating System: macOS Ventura

### Windows Tests
- Status: Not Run
- Test Hardware: Windows Desktop
- Operating System: Windows 11

## Implementation Notes

The current inventory implementation provides the following features:
- Dynamic inventory sizing with configurable slot count
- Item stacking with individual max stack sizes
- Various inventory operations (add, remove, move, split, optimize)
- Event-driven architecture for UI updates
- Memory-efficient item reference handling

## Next Steps

1. Complete all test cases and update this document with results
2. Implement UI components for inventory visualization
3. Create serialization system for inventory persistence
4. Integrate with item pickup system
5. Implement equipment slots and item type restrictions
