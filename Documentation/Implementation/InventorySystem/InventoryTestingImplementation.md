# Inventory System Testing Implementation

**Date**: April 26, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for testing the BetterWYD inventory system. It covers the test scene setup, UI components, script architecture, and testing methodology.

## Test Scene Setup
The inventory testing is implemented in a dedicated scene (`InventorySystemTest.unity`) that provides a controlled environment for validating all inventory operations.

### Key GameObject Structure
- **InventorySystem**: Primary controller for inventory management
- **TestController**: Handles test execution and result reporting
- **Canvas**: Contains all UI elements for visual representation

## UI Components
The test scene includes the following UI elements:

### Inventory Panel
- Located in the top-right corner of the screen
- Contains a grid of inventory slots (4x8 layout)
- Each slot displays item icons and stack counts

### Test Controls Panel
- Located at the bottom of the screen
- Contains buttons for triggering inventory operations:
  - Add Item: Adds a random item to the inventory
  - Remove Item: Removes a random item from the inventory
  - Optimize: Consolidates stacks of the same item
  - Clear All: Empties the inventory
  - Run Test Suite: Executes all automated tests

### Test Results Panel
- Located in the bottom-right corner
- Displays real-time test results and operation feedback

## Script Architecture

### Core Scripts
- **ItemDefinition**: ScriptableObject defining item properties
- **ItemDatabase**: Manages the collection of available items
- **InventoryManager**: Handles core inventory operations
- **InventoryTester**: Implements test cases and UI interaction

### Testing Methodology
Tests are categorized into:

1. **Manual Tests**: Using UI buttons to perform specific operations
2. **Automated Tests**: Comprehensive test suite validating:
   - Adding items (single and batch)
   - Removing items
   - Stack management
   - Inventory optimization
   - Edge cases (full inventory, non-existent items, etc.)

## Test Cases
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| INV-T01 | Add single stackable item | Item appears in first available slot |
| INV-T02 | Add duplicate stackable item | Stack count increments if possible |
| INV-T03 | Add item to full inventory | Operation fails, error message |
| INV-T04 | Remove existing item | Item disappears or stack decrements |
| INV-T05 | Remove non-existent item | Operation fails, error message |
| INV-T06 | Clear inventory | All slots emptied |
| INV-T07 | Optimize with fragmented stacks | Stacks consolidated properly |
| INV-T08 | Run stress test (100+ operations) | System maintains stability |

## Cross-Platform Considerations
The implementation accounts for differences between macOS and Windows:

- **File path handling**: Using Path.Combine() for platform-agnostic paths
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Platform-specific key combinations
- **UI scaling**: Responsive design for different screen resolutions

## Test Results and Findings
(This section will be updated as testing progresses)

## Next Steps
- Complete implementation of all test cases
- Document test results and issues found
- Apply findings to improve the core inventory system
- Integrate inventory system with character controller

## Technical Implementation Details

### ItemDefinition ScriptableObject
This foundational script defines all properties of inventory items:
- Basic identification (ID, name, description)
- Visual representation (icon, 3D model)
- Stacking behavior
- Item categorization
- Game-specific properties

### InventoryManager Implementation
The core inventory management system handles:
- Item addition with stack optimization
- Item removal and quantity tracking
- Full inventory clearing
- Stack consolidation and optimization
- Event notifications for UI updates

### Test Suite Implementation
The automated test suite covers:
1. **Basic Operation Tests**: Individual add/remove operations
2. **Stack Management Tests**: Proper stacking of identical items
3. **Capacity Tests**: Behavior when inventory is full
4. **Stress Tests**: Random operations in rapid succession
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Handling of error conditions
