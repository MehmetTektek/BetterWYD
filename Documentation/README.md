## Key Documents

- [Development Roadmap](./DevelopmentRoadmap.md): Overall project timeline and milestone planning
- [Technical Design Document](./TechnicalDesignDocument.md): Core technical architecture and systems
- [Game Design Document](./GameDesignDocument.md): Game mechanics, features, and content design
- [Documentation Standards](./Guidelines/DocumentationStandards.md): Standards for project documentation
- [Implementation Index](./Implementation/ImplementationIndex.md): Index of all implemented systems

## Implementation Documentation

The `Implementation` directory contains detailed documentation for each major system in the game. Each system has its own folder with documentation specific to that system's implementation.

To add documentation for a new implementation:

1. Choose the appropriate system folder (or create a new one if needed)
2. Use the [Implementation Template](./Implementation/ImplementationTemplate.md) as a starting point
3. Update the [Implementation Index](./Implementation/ImplementationIndex.md) with the new documentation

## Documentation Standards

All documentation should follow the standards defined in [Documentation Standards](./Guidelines/DocumentationStandards.md), including:

- Markdown formatting guidelines
- File naming conventions
- Documentation structure and organization
- Code documentation requirements

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to project documentation:

1. Follow the established documentation standards
2. Use the appropriate templates for each type of documentation
3. Keep documentation up to date with code changes
4. Cross-reference related documentation where appropriate
5. Include code examples when documenting implementation details

## Cross-Platform Considerations

Remember that BetterWYD is developed for multiple platforms. When documenting implementations:

- Note any platform-specific considerations
- Use forward slashes (`/`) in file paths for cross-platform compatibility
- Document any platform-specific configurations or optimizations

## Documentation Versioning

Documentation is versioned alongside the code in the Git repository. When making significant changes to documentation:

1. Include a "Last Updated" date in the document
2. Summarize changes in commit messages
3. Reference related code changes if applicable
